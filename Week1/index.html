        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> I am a media and info senior, and I will graduate this fall. I'm not really sure what I'm doing so far and am just kind of winging it, but I look forward to learning.</p>
        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <p> I like video games, sports, and being outdoors. Some of my favorite games include NCAA 14, Halo series, and Fallout 4.
        My favorite teams to follow are the Spartans (of course), Lions, Tigers and red wings. </p>
